      <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
      <p>Art is like a Rubik’s Cube: a colorful, deceptively simple puzzle with multi-layered components. As a chronic
        overthinker, I enjoy the strange sort of peace I feel as I focus on one of my paintings. Art is one of the few
        things
        I do wholly for myself. It’s not for school, or for my parents, or for the dreams I feel like I need to have.
        No,
        it’s
        a time to live in the moment: an effort to understand the world around me.</p>
      <p>
        While I sketch and paint people, animals, and objects, what I’m really interested in is everything not
        immediately
        obvious in my work -- ideas, systems, and emotions. With the advent of photography, realism has almost become
        redundant. Why show the same thing a camera captures, when the paper offers so much freedom? As I’ve honed my
        technical skills in multiple mediums, my style has grown increasingly experimental. I love playing with
        contrasting
        colors and textures; my fascination with tension creates dynamic, often vivid pieces that seek to capture the
        small
        nuances of the ordinary.
      </p>
      <p>
        My many thoughts contribute to my style, which is an impatient mix of cross-hatching and lines on paper or quick
        brushstrokes on canvas. I’m drawn to big cats and birds: cats because of their lithe strength, and birds because
        of
        their sleek feathers. I love the large brushstrokes of the Impressionist movement, but I’m often contained to
        small
        strokes because of my subject matter; creating the texture of feathers or fur requires a careful hand and a keen
        eye.
        Realism teaches me patience, while experimentation is an outlet for my creativity. I’m constantly trying to
        maintain
        that balance of substance and personality.</p>

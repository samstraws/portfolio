    <h1><em>What the Flock!</em> Game</h1>
    <div class="intro">

      <h3>Intro</h3>
      <p id="tagline">Helped build and design a melee-fighting game from the ground up.</p>
      <p>
        What the Flock was a semester-long project I made as part of an 8-person group in Spring 2021. As a coder and
        designer, I worked on both the mechanics of the game in Java and the animated sprites in Photoshop. As the team
        lead, I worked with the designers and coders to organize task flow on Trello. With my group, we also made many
        writeups selling our game concept and making it appealing to our target audience, the players of the Game Design
        showcase at the end of the semester.
      </p>

    <h3>Problem Space</h3>
    <p>Our goal was to build a fun, engaging game that incorporated an interesting cooking mechanic and had balanced
      mechanics. The cooking mechanic centered around an uncooked chicken. The player’s goals would be to 1. survive
      enemy
      hordes and 2. cook their chicken by raising its temperature. At any given time, the player’s chef character could
      either choose to whack enemies with their chicken or put it on the stove, cooking it. Whacking enemies would lower
      the temperature, while putting it on the stove cooked it.</p>

    <h3>Animations and Coding</h3>
    <p>I animated three sprites in Photoshop, for all three environmental traps: the toaster, hot sauce, and cooler. The
      entire team debated on the designs and concepts for what these separate traps would do. I then followed our
      pre-determined design guidelines to make trap designs that were appealing and colorful, trying to incorporate
      basic
      animation concepts (push and pull, exaggeration). These were my first animations.</p>
    <p>
      For coding, I focused on overall code structure and organization. Because our game was built on older prototype
      code, much of the organization and logic became obsolete as we added on new features. I often restructured and
      organized while also adding sprites I had colored in directly.
    </p>

    <h3>Other Design Work</h3>
    <p>As part of the team, I learned to prototype games physically, digitally, and most importantly -- quickly. Game
      mechanics took lots of time to tweak and adjust. I also dabbled in designing levels that focused on environmental
      interactions (having two traps in the vicinity of one another, for example). With my team, we broke certain game
      interactions into “blocks” we could then use to create levels.
    </p>
    <p>Additionally, I created the font on the level home screen and the cutting board background. I hand-lettered the
      font to match the fun and playful aesthetic established by the two other designers. I wanted an almost comic
      book-esque look, so I made sure that the curves of the font were still smooth.</p>
    <h3>Solution</h3>
    <p>Our final game contains roughly 20 levels, with 3 different environmental traps and 5 different enemy types. To
      validate the playability of our game, we showcased it at the end of the semester. Test players of all ages played
      it
      and gave us feedback.</p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>Building a game from the ground up was a large technical and artistic challenge. Many of the problems we
      encountered were on the logistics side -- organizing which team member was putting out which fire was an ordeal
      each
      week, especially on the two week sprints that we went through. Other than that, our biggest challenge was level
      design. If we had more time, I wish I could better tutorialize our game -- the difficulty grading on the levels is
      not consistent. I'd also love to get more player feedback and advice about how to teach players how to play the
      game
      better.</p>

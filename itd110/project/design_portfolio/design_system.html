    <h1>KPMG Design System</h1>
    <div class="intro">
      <h3>Intro</h3>
      <p id="tagline">To expediate and unify KPMG’s internal designs, I researched, designed, and fleshed out a branded
        design system
        in
        Adobe XD.</p>
    </div>
    <h3>Problem Space</h3>
    <p>KPMG is an international tax advisory and consulting company; I worked in the federal consulting branch, which
      developed projects (such as webpages or apps) for the government. As KPMG built up its design programs and
      projects,
      they looked for ways to make their designs cohesive and unified. Designers working on different projects may
      repeat
      work that their peers have done and may want to draw from existing designs.</p>
    <p>Large tech companies maintain design systems: a centralized library and guidelines that designers draw upon.
      However, KPMG’s designers were working on various projects, so no one had dedicated time to do this. Atomic Design
      by Brad Frost outlines a methodology for taking small design parts (e.g. buttons, font, colors) and building out
      larger elements (e.g. forms, home page), resulting in a cohesive and responsive system. My goal was to create a
      system that designers could navigate through (like a webpage) to quickly pull or build elements.</p>
    <h3>Ideation Phase</h3>
    <p>In my research phase, I had a few questions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>How do other companies lay out their design systems?</li>
      <li>What elements are included in those systems?</li>
      <li>What elements and themes are relevant to KPMG?</li>
      <li>How can I make this system useful for my coworkers?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Using a MURAL board and interviewing my team, I researched KPMG’s branding book (colors, typography) and our
      existing
      design system – a collection of fonts, colors, and elements. Early on, I established a common language to talk
      about
      my concepts. “Elements” are the basics of the system: the visual themes, color, typography. “Components” are
      small,
      common features made of elements such as buttons, accordions, or text boxes. “Patterns” are made of multiple
      components – login pages or navigation bars. Finally, “Data Visuals” are graphics that display data, such as pie
      charts or bar graphs.
      I was specifically drawn to Google’s Material’s use of philosophy and shape language. It takes a single shape or
      idea
      and builds-- for example, a slant motif to signify a travel brand’s efficiency is used on buttons.
    </p>
    <p>Drawing from my experience in game design, I wanted KPMG’s brand to feel snappy and responsive, instead of
      weightless – your actions have reactions. I mocked up some buttons that make the user feel like they are pushing a
      physical object up or down. The existing logo is slanted, so I also drew from that idea of forward motion.
      Hovering
      over key objects slant the text. Slightly rounded corners with a mostly rectangular style give it a professional
      feel.</p>
    <h3>Content</h3>
    <p>I also created a structure with reusable components (such as the navigation bar and simple headers) so that
      designers could easily navigate and build out the file. Inspired by Bootstrap, I created a high level structure of
      potential elements I wanted to include. I presented my project each week to the team to tweak plans and designs.
    </p>
    <p>Once I settled on the elements and design direction, I developed components and patterns. Inspired by Adobe’s
      Spectrum and Bootstrap, I developed components to fit specific scenarios. More important components popped more,
      lesser ones were more subtle. Then, I created content guidelines (based on my principles of simplicity) that show
      designers how to use the component.</p>
    <h3>Solution/Reflection</h3>
    <p>My final solution is in website format, with master components designers can pull from.This project taught me
      many
      new skills; I honed prototyping in Adobe XD and took classes on how the backend of Bootstrap functioned. The work
      I
      did continues to be used, especially since I made the elements of the design system itself into components.</p>

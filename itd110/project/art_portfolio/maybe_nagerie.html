    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <h3 id="box">Black (Cat) Box</h3>
    <p>This series aims to capture uncertainty and fear through the life cycle of an organism. The work draws
      inspiration
      from different forms of uncertainty: the Black (Cat) Box is directly inspired by the popular physics thought
      experiment, <dfn><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger%27s_cat">Schrodinger’s Cat</a></dfn>. In
      this
      theoretical experiment, a cat is sealed into a closed box with poison and a
      radioactive source, set up in such a way that there is a 50/50 chance of the cat dying. Before the box is opened,
      however, the cat can be considered both <em>dead and alive</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Because the original experiment centers around uncertainty, the joke of this work is that something terrible
      certainly happened. But there are traces of cats peppered in the whole series, which begs the question: did a cat
      die in this box? Is there another cat? What really happened?
    </p>

    <h3 id="cathuwu">Cathuwu</h3>
    <p>Another source of uncertainty I drew from were the works of <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft">H.P Lovecraft</a>, who is the namesake behind the phrase
      <dfn>“Lovecraftian horror”</dfn>. Lovecraft writes about cosmic horror entities (most famously Cthulhu) that drive
      people mad
      with their sheer unknowability. Humanity in these stories is portrayed as insignificant. Cathuwu pokes fun at what
      these entities represent: they inspire uncertainty and fear, yet can also be weird and silly, with flabby little
      fabric bodies that suggest they skipped leg day.

    <h3 id="life1">Life 1</h3>
    <p>My other main source of inspiration is myself, and mainly my anxiety regarding change. Coming out of college, I
      felt like I had left some unanswered questions. What did I want the next few years to look like? How did I want to
      spend my life? These thoughts kept me up at night, even though there was really nothing to be done about them. The
      series pokes fun at my own inability to let go of things, while also serving as some sort of cathartic exploration
      of feelings of inadequacy. The child in Life 1 is based on references of myself as a child. </p>

    <h3 id="life2">Life 2</h3>
    <p>Life 2 pulls from thoughts about masks and makeup. The mask has been painted with old lipstick and eyeliner that
      had begun stinging my face. For a very long time, I never wore or owned makeup. As I shifted into college, I
      wanted
      to be “sexier” and adult, and I maybe wanted people to take me more seriously. Stumbling through some painful jabs
      at my eyes eventually made me a bit more competent at makeup, which I still don’t wear regularly. When I do, it
      feels like armor against the world, but also suggests an erasure of imperfections and (perhaps) self. </p>

    <h3 id="life3">Life 3</h3>
    <p>Life 3 is based on a cat skeleton, which has 13 ribs. My friends often liken me to a cat, and dandelions are my
      favorite flowers for their resiliency, edibility, and nature as a weed. Perhaps there is certainty in death,
      though
      I’d like to think that the flowers suggest something new emerges from the body. </p>

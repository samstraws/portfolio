        <p>There’s a heady rush of being an independent traveler, alone in a foreign country. How much of that is fear
          that you don’t know the language, fear someone might pickpocket your bulky phone and leave you scrabbling
          without your passport? The fear is indistinguishable from the joy of breathing air unencumbered by the worries
          of home – the joy of seeing new and exciting things and giggling nervously as you get lost.</p>

        <p>I recently felt these uncertain winds stream past me in the hills of Verona, Italy. My mother and I –
          separated
          from my dad and brother for the first time! – e-biked through the hills of the Valpolicella region, a
          picturesque wine country sprawling with verdant hills and lush scenery. The self-guided bike tour took us to a
          wine tasting, where we explored modern giant cellars that smelled of bread yeast. We drank six different
          wines,
          enough to get me giggly and talkative and embarrassingly loud as I raved about artificial intelligence to the
          upper-crust British people next to me. </p>
        <p>But these are only the highlights of the journey. What I didn’t mention was the stressful bike out of the
          streets of Verona, crowded with tourists and packed with cars that speeded by. The chaos was exacerbated by
          the
          narrow paths and motorcyclists and more confident bikers, one of whom I saw (I kid you not) texting on their
          phone with both hands off the bars as they cycled past. I also didn’t mention my relative inexperience with
          biking, my blouse chewed up in the gears, or the nasty scrape that left my mom bleeding on sand.</p>

        <p>The most stressful part of the journey took place after the wine tasting, as I wobbled back onto my bike. My
          mom and I would have to traverse back through perilous, narrow streets as cars whizzed past. I kept stopping,
          certain that I had lost her or that the trail of cars was impassable. </p>
        <p>As I gingerly weaved through the line of cars, careful to stay out of their way, another man on a bike cut in
          front. Even in my haze, I could tell he was experienced – he darted through cars and confidently moved into
          the
          left lane of the intersection, prepping for a turn. I tailed him in amazement, focusing on how the cars (which
          I
          thought would bowl me over) naturally gave us space before jetting past. </p>
        <p>Following this man for the last ten minutes of this bike ride was an indescribable rush, some tipsy mix of
          security and power. I realized that I’d been making way for the cars around me, instead of claiming my right
          of
          way as a biker. Navigating through crowded streets suddenly became easier; I started to flow through the crowd
          the way I would as a pedestrian, except at the pace of the bike. </p>
        <p>But I still haven’t forgotten that initial fear that left me skittishly skirting traffic on the sides of busy
          roads. So much of my life is spent giving room for other people that don’t need it. I look over into the
          unwelcoming street of risk and failure (what if the car runs me over?) and I can’t veer into the right lane.
        </p>

        <p>The space between anxiety and action: this is the black hole my thoughts keep circling. The thought of
          leaving
          college and the safety of my home makes my throat swell into a warm, twisted ball of heartburn. I don’t know
          if
          I’m doing the right things for me. What if I lose myself? What if I change into something I don’t want to be?
          What if I’m unhappy?</p>
        <p>The truth is that I’m not alone in this. There will sometimes be a biker in front to show me the way if I’m
          careful enough to notice. More importantly, I remind myself that my imagination is sometimes more terrifying
          than the outside world. Learning different ways to relate to the world is painful and exhilarating. All I can
          do
          is continue to take these risks, to seek out freedom and adventure, and push myself to remember the joys of
          the
          unknown.</p>
